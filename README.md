In this paper we used a fuzzy predictive model to control a choatic signal by predicting the next values of the choatic time serie.
The wei.m file is differential equation. The solve_wei.m file is used to solve the equation. And to run this simulation simply run the Main.m file to get the results of controlling this choatic time series.
